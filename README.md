# Pommerman A2C
Solution to the Pommerman enviroment (similar design as bomberman on nintendo) using the Advantage Actor Critic (A2C) algorithm without parallelization. We would highly recommend reading Rudy Gilman's simple and intuitive explanation of the [A2C algorithm](https://hackernoon.com/intuitive-rl-intro-to-advantage-actor-critic-a2c-4ff545978752) before trying to understand our implementation. To run the code, download the folder and run *Pommerman-A2C.ipynb* using jupyter notebook. You should already have installed pip, pytorch and jupyter notebook before you can run our code
